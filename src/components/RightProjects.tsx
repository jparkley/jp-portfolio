          Utilizing tools like OpenAPI and Apollo, I architect efficient RESTful
          APIs and dynamic GraphQL endpoints, while crafting intuitive user
          interfaces with Tailwind, Material UI, or Bootstrap to adhere to
          responsive design principles. My toolkit extends to include Jest, Git,
          Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Datadog, Loggly, Figma, and SEO, ensuring
          excellence in every project.

          As a certified AWS developer, I consistently challenge the boundaries
          of serverless development, driven by my passion for innovation and
          lifelong learning. My goal is to deliver solutions that not only meet
          business objectives but also bring joy to users.
